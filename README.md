# texclean

Ever wanted a quick and easy way to remove all the files generated by a LaTeX
compilation and get back to just your work? Here it is.


## Installation

Grab the source code from https://github.com/ajdawson/texclean and install:

    $ python setup.py install


## Usage

Simplest use case to delete compilation files for a document named
`my_document.tex`:

    $ texcleaner.py my_document

To clean everything but keep `my_document.pdf` and `my_document.dvi`:

    $ texcleaner.py -k pdf,dvi my_document

To clean everything including `my_document.baz`:

    $ texcleaner.py -d baz my_document


## Configuration

You can configure which extensions to delete and which to keep using a
configuration file. The default location for the configuration file is
`~/.texcleanerrc`. The configuration file should include lines of the form:

    extension : keep

or

    extension : delete

A setting of `delete` tells `texcleaner.py` to delete files with that extension
by default, and `keep` tells it to keep files of that extension by default.
These settings can be overridden on the command line.
